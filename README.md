# VU-Noclip
No clip mod for Venice Unleashed. Last updated back in 2019 the mod did not work anymore in the current state of VU, so I updated it. Also added the functionality to move up-down and left-right, and to toggle noclip. Further the no-clip movement speed can be altered with the mouse wheel.

To activate no clip press V. Move around with WASD. Go up and down with Q and E. And change the movement factory with the scroll wheel.
